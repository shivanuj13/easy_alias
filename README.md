When you run `ea`, select `Add Alias` from the menu. You will be prompted:

```
=== Easy Alias CLI ===
  1. Add Alias
  2. List Aliases
  3. Update Alias
  4. Delete Alias
  5. Activate Aliases
  6. Deactivate Aliases
  7. Save & Activate
  8. Exit
Select an option (number, or type "exit" to exit): 1
Enter shortcut: gs
Enter command: git status
‚úÖ Alias "gs" added.
```

You can now use the menu to activate, list, or manage your aliases.

> **Note:** After adding, updating, or deleting aliases, you must select **Save & Activate** from the menu for your changes to take effect in your shell. Then, restart your terminal or re-source your shell config to use the updated aliases.

### Menu Options
- Add Alias
- List Aliases (shows status: ‚úÖ active, ‚ùå inactive, üîµ found in shell config)
- Update Alias (choose by shortcut or number, only managed aliases)
- Delete Alias
- Activate Aliases (select which to activate)
- Deactivate Aliases (select which to deactivate)
- Save & Activate
- Exit

### Notes
- After activating or saving aliases, **restart your terminal** to see the changes take effect.
- Aliases are stored in `~/.easy_aliases.json`.
- The generated shell alias file is `~/.easy_aliases.sh`.
- The tool modifies your `~/.zshrc` (or other shell config) to source the alias file.
- Only aliases managed by Easy Alias can be updated or deleted from the CLI.
